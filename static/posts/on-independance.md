# On Independance

It's been a little over 2 years when I started really diving into *Computer Science*. I have been learning at a really accelerated pace. It's funny because I always thought myself to be "techy", whatever that means. I was just drawn to things I didn't really understand. 

The journey starting with "Workday" wasn't really technological. Even if it glimpsed on aspects of technology, like certain programming languages, i.e **MVEL** and basic **Javascript**, it really doesn't count to me as a technological journey. For me, I have to admit that spending 4 years there, trying to convicne myself I was on a tech journey is now baffling. 

Over this past years, I started diving little by little into this gigantic iceberg:

I guess I am now in Rust. This very blog is written in Rust, and god it has been so much fun. I still have little clue of what is happening in the background, but I am definitelly closer than I was before. 

But something happened along the way. Everytime I stayed in the surface I felt very secure and comfortable. For example:

Learning Django has been part of my development in the past 6 months, so that I can participate more and more on the backend with my team. Looking for documentation on how to use Serializers, or use HTML Forms is actually quet nice. You have a framework, it has clear boundaries, you swim in this box, where answers are there. Pretty much anything you need to know you can find, so it's easier to feel like you are making progress learning a framework. 

I started to notice, that the bigger questions can't be really answered by staying on the surface, in the real programming world, frameworks are tools, but the concepts go beyond those tools. A bit back, I had some luck finding this guy who sort of opened my eyes to this:

But I digress. What's interesting about that vide, besided the fact that this guy is clearly very arrogant. Is that he does pose a great point. By saying you are an Engineer because you mastered a framework, you may be missing the bigger picutre. Essentially calling those who stay in the surface: **Translators** of Requirements. 

What that means is that basically, you have mastered translating Enlgish (Or whatever the source lang is) into "Django" let's say. That does not make you an Engineer, it makes you a translator. Learning specific syntax does not constitute programming per se. It is understanding the details behind the frameworks, and the problems they are trying to solve, in other words, abstracting the framework, that you can truly begin to understand and leverage those tools in the first place as part of your engineering tasks. 

If I spend most of my days mastering Django, I will be very good at it. But Django falls short for certain tasks. For example, Big Data processing. But If I only know Django, I would probably believe that it can solve it with the right tweaks, without understanding that other frameworks can and will be better made for that specific purpose. 

If I start understanding Data Processing, and the problems behind that, I will realize that there are certain things that are limiting about Django. Django is a high-level Python web framework:

- Not Designed for Data Processing: Django is designed for web development. Its primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. 
- Scalability Challenges: While Django can handle a high level of requests per second when serving web pages, it is not designed to scale horizontally in the way that big data processing frameworks like Hadoop or Spark are. 
- Performance: For compute-intensive big data tasks, languages like Java or C++ or specialized data processing frameworks like Apache Spark or Hadoop are often more suitable.
- I/O Bound rather than CPU Bound. 
- ETC 

On the other side, understanding the horizontal scaling of Big Data, the quantities, and the memory management required to process data, etc, makes you evaluate different tools. For example Apache Spark is an amazing framework for big data processing.  Unlike Django, which is tailored for web development, Spark is designed for large-scale data processing.

Anyway, the point is: The better you understand overall the problems and the solutions out there, with granular level of understanding of the "under the hood" dynamics, the better you become at solving problems.

This was really difficult to abstract. Specially because there is too much information to process out there. 
- Too many tools
- Too many concepts
- Too many Open Source projects

Too many everything. But slowly and surely, the more you know, the crazier the iceberg starts to get.

But here is the crazy part, I have started to realize, that understanding the problems and solutions that certain companies are delivering, the more I am able to see that independance is not that difficult. It just requires knowledge. The mindset goes along this lines.

- Understand the problem: What is this tool solving, why is it here.
- What was the solution, can it be enhanced, are there any other forms of solving the problem.
- Can we document and explain the concept.
- Can we implement the solution?

For example. A while back, I discovered Github Codespaces. I was mindblown. You can code in your browser, and compute on a different computer. WTF. 

- Problem: Local machines are limitted in compute power
- Solution: Create a front end that can connect to a remote server and compute the work there. Accessible via Browser. 
- Can we use different tools, can we implement this: YES we can :D. Code Server a Gigantic Project can be self hosted. It was built with Typescript mostly, some HTML leveraging the open source aspects of VS code.
- Yes we can.
- Yes we can. X2

Yes we can is so good.

I am taking steps towards Digital Freedom, and I would like to get rid of all the my dependencies on this services. The more dependant we are on tools and services we don't understand, the stupider we are getting. 

God - we even order food to our doors. But I won't get started on that topic. 

I realize the more advanced the technologies out there, the more complex things get, and striving to be able to understand those tools will make you extremely resourceful. By becoming independant you become irreplacable. 

Everyone can replace a Translator, but you can't replace the people who go beyond that so easily. AI will come, and those who don't understand the inner workings of technology will be eaten. And I don't want to be eaten or be left in the irrelevant corner while other people get to play. I invite you to join me in this independance journey.
